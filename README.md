# PathfinderGen
Old version of our path generation tool, which uses [Pathfinder](https://github.com/JaciBrunning/Pathfinder), which is no longer being actively supported. I believe we made this as a copy of [PathGen](https://github.com/4201VitruvianBots/PathGen) because we ran into an issue with it and were trying to make a workaround. The newer vserion of our tool is [TrajectoryGen](https://github.com/4201VitruvianBots/TrajectoryGen), which uses WPILib trajectories.
